This is a repository of the earthquakehtml5 project.

The name of the application is same and can be found hosted at http://earthquakehtml5.appspot.com/

This is a Google App Engine project and in fact GAE is just used for hosting the project online with no usages of GQL or anything GAE specific and consists of the following external libraries and dependencies.

2013-earthquake.js
data.json, data2.json and query.json: earthquake data in json format from usgs.gov
leaflet.js
raphael-min.js
rlayer.js

In order to run the code on your own machine simply host the application as a gae application and modify app.yaml file for a convenient application name.


The folder a static example with heatmap contains another example in which concentrations of earthquake can be seen based on the region one is in. A dynamic example of the same is a good idea but the problem is the concentration and density of the points. The idea can be easily seen by uncommenting the section on heatmap in the main.js file.
